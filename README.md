# Overview
This is intended to be a quick prototype of a bash script for using a hashtag organization system for my notetaking. First draft of requirements: what I'd like to be able to do is:
1. Use hashtags to identify topics/themes in my own notes/docs.
1. Use a script to get a list of all my hashtags/topics
1. Use a script to find all files containing that hashtag, or even the line of the file.
1. Easily browse the search results to find what interests me or look for themes.

# Time boxing v1.0 - striving for agile dev!
* 6:15p - Start work
* 7:15p - Going to stop work
* Got the 2 key proof of concept tasks done in 30 minutes! (#2 and 3 above)
* 7:30pm - feel motivated to keep going to a little bit more. Going to try 1-2 more microtasks
* 9:15pm - STOP. got a few buttons and forms on my page. It's not quite functional. Need to tie it together.
